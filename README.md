Floema is an interactive web experience project inspired by the work of Luis Bizarro, award wining developer. This project leverages the powers of 11ty and Vite for enhanced performance and modularity.

[See Demo](https://floema-jwl.vercel.app/)

## Main tools

- 11ty (Eleventy): A light yet powerful static site generator offering swiftness in build times, data flexibility, and a broad template language support.
- Vite: A groundbreaking build tool and development server that drastically improves frontend development experience with features like lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Enhanced and performant animations for the web.
- WebGL (OGL): For interactivity and effects making this a truly interactive web experience.
- SCSS: Improved CSS
- Primic: Hassle-free, dynamic content managment
